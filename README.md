# Scarpet interpreter

Kinda nicked off of here: https://github.com/Advait-Sen/ScarpetInterpreter

This implementation of scarpet is just a whole lot easier to use, so we're using it.
It's modified to work in java 8, and will be used in https://github.com/Dustless-SMP/Scarpet-1.12.

It's meant to be a bare-bones version which is easy to transfer manually, and which <s>will then be</s> has now been archived.

## License
We use the license to the stricter [Mozilla Public License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/)

Note that this fork will not be updated, go to the parent repo for that.
