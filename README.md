# Scarpet interpreter

Kinda nicked off of here: https://github.com/Advait-Sen/ScarpetInterpreter

This implementation of scarpet is just a whole lot easier to use, so we're using it.
It's modified to work in java 8, and will be used in https://github.com/Dustless-SMP/Scarpet-1.12.

It's meant to be a bare-bones version which is easy to transfer manually, and which will then be archived.
